Revising the Panopto PDF Video Troubleshooting Documentation:

After having an issue with Panopto for one of my classes, I downloaded their troubleshooting directions. However, after 
reading through them I found they were difficult to follow and decided to revise them as a small side-project.

The original document is listed under "PDFView", while my revised version is listed under 
"Panotpto Troubleshooting Instructions - Revised"
